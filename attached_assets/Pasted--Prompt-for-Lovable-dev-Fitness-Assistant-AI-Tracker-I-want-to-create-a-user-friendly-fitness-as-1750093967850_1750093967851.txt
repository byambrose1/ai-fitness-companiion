üß† Prompt for Lovable.dev: Fitness Assistant AI Tracker

I want to create a user-friendly fitness assistant web app that helps people who are either trying to lose fat or gain weight by analysing their habits and giving tailored AI feedback.
The app should have a modern, mobile-first design with a clear, friendly tone using British English throughout.
üë§ The user flow should start with a multi-step form that collects the following sections of information:
1. Personal Information

Email (required)
Date of birth (must be 18+)
Biological sex (Female / Male / Other)
Height in cm
Current weight in kg
Goal weight (optional)
2. Fitness Goal & Motivation

What is your primary fitness goal? (Fat loss / Muscle gain / General health / Mental wellbeing)
Why do you want to achieve this goal? Include both structured options and a free text box (e.g., recent breakup, grief, confidence, health scare, self-love, etc.)
3. Mental & Emotional State

Current mental/emotional state (free text)
Motivation level (1 to 10)
Mood most days (options + free text input in case someone wants to write something like "depressed")
4. Health & Medical

Any medications? (Yes/No with optional text)
Any diagnosed health conditions (e.g., thyroid, PCOS)?
If biologically female, ask: Are you on your period, approaching it, or unsure?
5. Sleep & Recovery

Average hours of sleep per night
How do they feel when waking up? (Refreshed / Tired / Exhausted)
6. Nutrition Habits

Typical protein sources (free text: e.g. 2 chicken breasts, 1 protein shake, tofu)
Typical number of meals/snacks per day
Water intake estimate
Eating habits (Home-cooked / Takeaways / Mix)
Food habits (how often they eat out, cook, or order food)
7. Movement & Activity

Activity level (Sedentary to Very Active)
Exercise type/frequency (free text)
Do they use any wearables? (Apple Watch, Fitbit, etc.)
8. Body & Tracking

Weekly weight check-in input (optional but prompted)
Recent weight changes (lost, gained, no change)
How they feel in their body (free text)
9. Lifestyle

Weekly stress level (1‚Äì10)
Support system (yes/no + optional explanation)
10. AI Consent

Do they want a custom AI-generated feedback summary based on their answers?
üí° Key Features:
After form submission, show a summary results page:
Smart feedback with 2‚Äì3 personalised AI-generated tips
Brief emotional check-in summary
Suggestions based on sleep, nutrition, and motivation
Use placeholder text where helpful ("e.g. 2 chicken breasts, 1 smoothie")
If user selects ‚ÄúMale‚Äù, skip any menstrual questions
Only show form to users over 18 (DOB input)
Use British English spelling and labels
Include logic so each section only appears after the previous is completed
Allow users to input rough food descriptions (not just grams or calories)
The design should be modern, engaging, and supportive. Think helpful, holistic, and personalised ‚Äî not intimidating. The goal is to help users feel guided and cared for, not judged.
