✅ FULL UPDATED PROMPT
App Name: AI Fitness Companion
Tone: Supportive, inclusive, hormone-aware, non-gendered, motivating, and user-friendly
Language: British English

🟢 1. Questionnaire Updates

Change "biological sex" to "sex assigned at birth".
The primary fitness goal is fat loss. There should be no other options.
Reduce the number of pages in the questionnaire. Group related questions together to avoid form fatigue — ideally no more than 4–5 screens total.
Avoid repetition. Review and remove questions that ask the same thing in slightly different ways.
Ensure all questions are clear, concise, and written in layman's terms.
Menstrual & Menopause Logic:
If user selects "Female" or "Assigned Female at Birth", prompt:
“Do you have periods?”
If YES:
Ask: “Where are you in your cycle today?”
Options: “Just started”, “Middle of cycle”, “About to start”, “Not sure”
If NO:
Ask: “Are you going through the menopause?”
If YES: Ask which stage:
“Perimenopausal”
“Menopausal”
“Postmenopausal”
If NO: Move on with no further questions.
If user selects "Male" or "Assigned Male at Birth", skip all cycle and menopause questions.
🟢 2. Weekly Weight Check-Ins & AI Prompts

Remove the question about whether users want weekly weight check-ins — they are included automatically, but should be optional to log.
Remove the question asking if users want personalised AI feedback — it’s part of the core service and should not be optional.
Add AI-generated feedback based on user input (e.g. “Why didn’t I lose weight this week?”, “I’m tired today, why?”).
If a user logs a negative state, such as stress or fatigue, the app should return a supportive, empathetic message based on the mood logged (e.g. “Sorry to hear you’re feeling this way — today might be a good day to go easy and take care of yourself.”)
🟢 3. UI/UX + Visual Design

Fonts must be modern, clean and readable. Use something like Inter, Poppins, or Nunito Sans.
Change font and title after completing the questionnaire (“Welcome to your fitness journey”). Use consistent font and a white background for clarity.
Use a consistent colour scheme across all pages.
Suggested colour palette:
Mint green background: #D1F2EB
Deep green accent: #3B7A57
Use white backgrounds for forms/dashboards
Remove current landing page banner/logo and replace with a clean hero section explaining:
What the app does
Who it’s for (men and women)
That it gives hormone-aware, AI-powered, personalised daily insights
With a clear call-to-action: “Start Your Journey”
🟢 4. User Flows & Logic

When a user clicks “Weekly Check-in” from the dashboard, it should go to the weekly check-in form.
After clicking “Back” from any check-in screen, it should return them to the dashboard — not the landing page.
Once signed in, users should not be able to return to the landing page.
Add an option to sign up immediately from the landing page or after completing the questionnaire — both paths should funnel into the same dashboard and data collection.
Once a user completes the questionnaire, store their data securely and associate it with their login.
Only users aged 18 and above should be able to use the app (DOB check required on sign-up).
🟢 5. Data Capture & Tracking

Add ability to track fitness activity manually or via fitness watches (Fitbit, Apple Watch, etc.).
Add prompt for whether user wears a fitness tracker in onboarding or settings.
If wearable data isn’t yet supported, allow manual input of:
Steps
Exercise type (from dropdown)
Duration
Intensity (scale or options)
Encourage daily logs with:
Food log (text entry)
Stress, sleep, mood, energy — all tracked via simple scales, not textboxes
🟢 6. Daily Log Confirmation

After a user submits their daily log, show a confirmation screen with a personalised, supportive message based on their input. Examples:
“Thanks for logging your day. Stress levels look high today – maybe take a walk or get a little extra rest if you can.”
“Sleep looked solid last night — great work staying consistent!”
Rotate 4–5 variations of these confirmation prompts to keep it human and fresh.
✅ Final Notes

Everything should be gender-inclusive, simple, non-patronising, and tailored to help users understand themselves without overwhelming them.
Keep the emotional tone uplifting, human, and compassionate, even when giving corrective feedback.
