A fully custom, AI-powered, lifestyle-aware fitness and fat-loss companion app that helps individuals track daily behaviours, receive personalised feedback based on hormone status, lifestyle, sleep, stress, and activity levels, and make informed improvements without guesswork. This platform is gender-neutral and built for both men and women, including those with hormone fluctuations (e.g. menstrual cycle, menopause).

🧩 Core Features to Build on Replit:

✅ 1. User Authentication & Onboarding
	•	Email & password sign-up
	•	Must be 18+
	•	Users must complete a one-time onboarding questionnaire that includes:
	•	Name, DOB, sex assigned at birth
	•	Do you menstruate? → If yes:
	•	Are your cycles regular?
	•	Are you tracking them?
	•	Where are you in your cycle now?
	•	If no: Menopausal stage (pre, peri, menopausal, post)
	•	Daily sitting time
	•	Chronic conditions (selectable list + custom input)
	•	Medications (especially hormone-related)
	•	Primary health goal: fat loss only

⚠️ Logic: User cannot progress until all relevant fields are filled
⚠️ After completion, they must be directed to sign up if not already done

⸻

✅ 2. Daily Logging Interface

Allow users to input daily:
	•	Food log (with natural language input, e.g. “chicken salad and 2 boiled eggs”)
	•	Workout type (select from dropdown) and duration
	•	Weight (optional)
	•	Mood
	•	Sleep duration
	•	Stress level (1–10)
	•	Water intake
	•	Movement (steps, time active — if wearable connected)

🧠 AI should detect:
	•	Overweighing (warn user gently)
	•	Inconsistencies (e.g. high stress + poor sleep = reduced fat loss)
	•	If weight gain is likely water weight

⸻

✅ 3. Weekly Check-in

Prompt user weekly to input:
	•	Average adherence
	•	Bloating, energy, hunger
	•	Whether they followed the plan
	•	Weight difference (optional)

➡️ Return AI-generated feedback based on all tracked data.

⸻

✅ 4. AI Feedback Engine

Using OpenAI (ChatGPT):
	•	If user asks:
	•	“Why didn’t I lose weight this week?”
	•	“Why do I feel bloated today?”
	•	“What should I improve next week?”

➡️ The chatbot will analyse recent logs + hormone info + behaviour and generate a realistic, supportive, educational response.

✅ 5. Dashboard (Post-login)
	•	Shows scores:
	•	Nutrition score
	•	Movement score
	•	Recovery score
	•	Shows current cycle status (if applicable)
	•	Shows AI feedback summary

	•	Include 5 rotating prompts (if user hasn’t logged)
