    üìä WEEKLY ANALYSIS - PREMIUM AI INSIGHTS
    
    üéØ OVERALL PROGRESS:
    ‚Ä¢ Weight Loss: 0.9kg (78.5kg ‚Üí 77.6kg)
    ‚Ä¢ Average Daily Score: {sum(calculate_quick_score(log) for log in daily_logs)/7:.1f}/10
    ‚Ä¢ Consistency Rate: 7/7 days logged (100%)
    
    üí° KEY PATTERNS IDENTIFIED:
    
    1. STRESS-WEIGHT CONNECTION:
    Your data reveals a clear correlation between stress levels and weight fluctuations:
    ‚Ä¢ High stress days (Day 2: stress=7) ‚Üí weight maintenance/small gain
    ‚Ä¢ Low stress days (Day 6: stress=2) ‚Üí better recovery and weight loss
    ‚Ä¢ Recommendation: Continue yoga/mindfulness on high-stress days
    
    2. SLEEP QUALITY IMPACT:
    ‚Ä¢ Best weight loss occurred after 7.5-8.5 hours of sleep
    ‚Ä¢ Your Fitbit confirms: Sleep scores 80+ correlate with lower resting heart rate
    ‚Ä¢ Optimal sleep window for you appears to be 7.5-8 hours
    
    3. MOVEMENT VARIETY SUCCESS:
    ‚Ä¢ Strength training (Days 1,4): Built lean muscle, higher calorie burn
    ‚Ä¢ Cardio (Days 2,7): Improved cardiovascular health, consistent fat burn
    ‚Ä¢ Yoga (Day 3): Stress reduction, flexibility, mindful eating
    ‚Ä¢ Walking (Day 5): Social integration, sustainable movement
    
    4. NUTRITION PATTERNS:
    ‚Ä¢ Higher protein breakfasts (Greek yogurt, eggs, smoothies) = stable energy
    ‚Ä¢ Afternoon hunger appears when lunch protein is insufficient
    ‚Ä¢ Evening stress eating triggered by work pressure, not physical hunger
    
    üîÆ PREDICTIVE INSIGHTS:
    
    Based on your data patterns, here's what to expect:
    ‚Ä¢ Continue current approach: 0.5-1kg loss per week is sustainable
    ‚Ä¢ Focus weeks (low stress + good sleep): Expect 1-1.5kg loss
    ‚Ä¢ High stress weeks: Maintain weight, focus on consistency not scale
    
    üìà PERSONALIZED RECOMMENDATIONS FOR WEEK 2:
    
    1. NUTRITION OPTIMIZATION:
    ‚Ä¢ Add 20g protein to lunch to prevent afternoon hunger
    ‚Ä¢ Keep stress-fighting foods handy: herbal tea, dark chocolate (85%+)
    ‚Ä¢ Increase water on rest days (you tend to drink less)
    
    2. MOVEMENT REFINEMENT:
    ‚Ä¢ Perfect weekly structure: 2 strength, 2 cardio, 1 yoga, 1 active recovery
    ‚Ä¢ Increase strength training duration to 55 minutes (you're ready!)
    ‚Ä¢ Add 5-minute morning walk on rest days for gentle movement
    
    3. STRESS MANAGEMENT:
    ‚Ä¢ Schedule yoga on Tuesdays (historically high stress day)
    ‚Ä¢ Set phone reminders for 3 water breaks during work hours
    ‚Ä¢ Practice 2-minute breathing exercises before meals
    
    4. SLEEP OPTIMIZATION:
    ‚Ä¢ Your sweet spot is 7.5-8 hours - prioritize this
    ‚Ä¢ Avoid late dinners on social nights (affects sleep quality)
    ‚Ä¢ Your best RHR (64-66bpm) occurs with quality sleep
    
    üèÜ WHAT'S WORKING BRILLIANTLY:
    ‚Ä¢ Variety in workouts prevents boredom and plateaus
    ‚Ä¢ Honest food logging (including indulgences) enables accurate insights
    ‚Ä¢ Wearable data integration provides objective health metrics
    ‚Ä¢ Self-awareness in notes helps identify emotional eating triggers
    
    ‚ö†Ô∏è WATCH POINTS:
    ‚Ä¢ Stress eating pattern on work days - have backup strategies ready
    ‚Ä¢ Water intake drops on weekends - set phone reminders
    ‚Ä¢ Don't panic at daily weight fluctuations - focus on weekly trends
    
    üéØ WEEK 2 TARGETS:
    ‚Ä¢ Maintain current loss rate (0.5-1kg)
    ‚Ä¢ Improve average daily score to 8.5+/10
    ‚Ä¢ Add 500 more daily steps (current average: 8,251)
    ‚Ä¢ Reduce average stress level from 4 to 3.5
    
    üí™ YOUR SUCCESS FORMULA:
    Strength Training + Adequate Sleep + Stress Management + Honest Tracking = Sustainable Fat Loss
    
    Remember: You lost almost 1kg while still enjoying date night pizza! This proves you're building a lifestyle, not following a restrictive diet. Keep this balance - it's your superpower! üåü
